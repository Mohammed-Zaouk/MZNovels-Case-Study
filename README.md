---

A completely free novel reading and publishing platform, built and operated solo for over two years.
Writers can publish their work, and readers can discover and read freely — no subscriptions, no paywalls.
Serving over **100,000 genuine users** and **4M+ page views** with no marketing budget.

## Highlights

- Built and deployed solo from scratch — backend, frontend, infrastructure, and ops
- Custom OAuth2 authentication backend (Google sign-in) alongside Django's native auth system
- Full-text search across novels and chapters powered by Whoosh (no external search service)
- Dockerized deployment on a Linux VPS with Nginx, Gunicorn, and MySQL
- Diagnosed and mitigated a sustained bot traffic campaign using container-level log analysis and Nginx rate limiting

## Features

### For Readers
- Browse and read novels for free — no subscription or paywall
- Advanced search and filtering by genre, tags, and ranking
- Bookmark novels and track reading progress across chapters
- User profiles with avatars
- Sign in with Google via OAuth2

### For Writers
- Publish and manage novels from a dedicated writer dashboard
- Full chapter editor with rich-text formatting
- Chapter ordering and management tools
- Cover image uploads and novel metadata editing

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Django, Python |
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript |
| Database | MySQL |
| Search | Whoosh |
| Auth | Django Auth + Custom OAuth2 (Google) |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn, VPS (Linux / Vultr) |

## Architecture Overview

The application is a Django monolith — the right call for a solo project where shipping speed and Django's mature ecosystem (admin panel, ORM, built-in auth) mattered more than distributed services. The frontend is server-rendered with Django templates; no separate SPA layer, which kept the deployment surface manageable.

The stack runs across four Docker containers:

- **Web** — Django application served via Gunicorn
- **Nginx** — reverse proxy, static file serving, SSL termination, and rate limiting
- **Database** — MySQL, with a dedicated initialization container for setup and migrations

Authentication is handled by a custom OAuth2 backend (`oauth2_backend.py`, `adapters.py`, `backends.py`) layered on top of Django's auth system, so user sessions stay entirely under application control with no third-party auth dependency.
